# VEHICLE-NUMBER-PLATE-DETECTION-SYSTEM

A designing of a system which captures the image of the number plate
automatically of a Shovel-Dumper combination and these details were verified
using Raspberry Pi processor for authentication. This system captures the number
plate of shovel and dumper further processing for the character recognition.
Automation is the most frequently spelled term in the field of electronics. The
hunger for automation brought many revolutions in the existing technologies. This
paper makes use of an onboard computer, which is commonly termed as
Raspberry Pi processor. It acts as heart of the project. This onboard computer can
efficiently communicate with the output and input modules which are being used.
The device which is able to perform the task is a Raspberry Pi processor. When
any vehicle passes by the system, the image of the number plate of every vehicle
is captured using camera. The image of the number plate details are fed as input
to the Raspberry Pi processor. The Processor takes responsibility to check the
authentication details of every shover and dumper. Once the details are
recognized then the processor operates it detects an unauthorized image of
number plate was detected. To perform this task, Raspberry Pi processor is
programmed using embedded ‘Raspbian’.
